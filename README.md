## Steps on how to create a github page
On your GitHub repository, go to the settings. On the left side, click the pages and then under the branch part, click the first dropdown and select main.  
Click save and then wait for a few minutes until the site is reflected on the GitHub pages section of the settings.

## Key takeaways from this exercise
I realized that GitHub can really be a powerful tool for collaboration when utilized properly. But the commands can be overwhelming too.  
The same is true with CSS. It can be fun, but there are lots of elements you have to familiarize yourself with.
